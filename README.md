## Advanced Deep Learning Course Projects (Tehran University)

This repository contains the projects I completed for the Advanced Deep Learning course at Tehran University.

**Getting Started**

- This repository assumes you have Python and a deep learning framework like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras installed.

**Contents**

This repository includes folders for each project.  Each folder will likely contain:

- Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts implementing the project.
- Data files used for training and testing (if applicable).
- README.md file (optional, for project-specific details).

**Project Descriptions**

**1. Face Recognition**

This project explored techniques for recognizing faces in images. 

**2. Transfer Learning**

This project focused on leveraging pre-trained models for new tasks using transfer learning techniques. 

**3. Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)**

This project introduced Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for learning latent representations of data.

**4. Adversarial Attacks**

This project explored adversarial attacks, a method for intentionally fooling deep learning models.

**5. Interpretability & Fairness in DistilBERT**

This project investigated interpretability and fairness considerations in deep learning models.

**Presentation:**

A presentation about Deep Leakage in Deep Networks which refers to the unintended disclosure of private information.
