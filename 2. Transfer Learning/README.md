### **Project 2: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**

The EfficientNet-B0 model is a convolutional neural network and one of the seven EfficientNet models. These models are designed with a focus on the application of image classification, and each one has different accuracy in image classification; Their main difference is in the number of parameters of each. Many researchers have already trained these models on different data and the weights obtained from these trainings are available on the Internet.
In this project, we consider the EfficientNet-B model trained on the ImageNet dataset as the base model and by fine tuning it on the Stanford Cars dataset-car196 dataset, we increase our classification accuracy on this dataset.
