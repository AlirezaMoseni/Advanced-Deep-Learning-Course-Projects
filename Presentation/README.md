### **Presentation: Deep Leakage**

Deep leakage is a critical issue in neural networks, particularly when dealing with sensitive data. It occurs when the model unintentionally memorizes specific input samples, including private information, and leaks it during inference. This phenomenon undermines privacy and security, making it essential to address.

In this presentation, we explore the **Deep Leakage from Gradients** paper, providing meticulous details about the method. Additionally, we discuss strategies for addressing this issue.
