### **Project 5: Interpretability & Fairness in DistilBERT**

In this project, by implementing a BERT model and familiarizing ourselves with it, we will examine how this model works and come to an explanation regarding the decisions of this model for a set of specific input sentences.
To speed up the execution of the codes in this section, we use the DistilBERT model, which is a smaller and faster BERT model.
The dataset that we will use in this project is to determine whether the grammar of an English text is correct or incorrect, and it contains sentences whose labels indicate whether the sentence is grammatically correct or incorrect.

we are using LIME and SHAP methods, which are Local Model-Agnostic methods, to better describe the functionality of the model.
